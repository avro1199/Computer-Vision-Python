# Computer Vision in Python

A comprehensive collection of Python scripts, notebooks, and resources for computer vision projects using OpenCV, YOLO, and similar tools.

## About

This repository documents my work and experiments in computer vision using Python. It includes practical code for image processing, object detection, video analysis, and real-world applications. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced user, you'll find useful examples and project ideas here.

## Topics & Tools

- **OpenCV**: Image processing, filtering, transformations, feature detection
- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection (YOLOv5/YOLOv8 and more)
- **Other Libraries**: scikit-image, PIL, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based vision)
- **Projects**: Custom vision applications, video analysis, face recognition, etc.

## Structure

- `/opencv/` ‚Äì OpenCV tutorials, scripts, and experiments
- `/yolo/` ‚Äì YOLO-based object detection (training, inference, dataset prep)
- `/image_processing/` ‚Äì Image enhancement, filtering, morphological operations
- `/video_analysis/` ‚Äì Video capture, motion detection, tracking
- `/projects/` ‚Äì End-to-end projects and demos
- `/notebooks/` ‚Äì Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Guides, theory, and references

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (where provided).
3. Explore the folders for topic-specific scripts and notebooks.
4. Run Python scripts or open `.ipynb` files in JupyterLab/Notebook.
5. Adapt and expand the code for your own computer vision projects!

## Contribution

Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or share your own computer vision code.
